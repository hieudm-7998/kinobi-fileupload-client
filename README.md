## Breakdowns

* This project is using *Nuxt 2* and *Vuejs 2* (this takes a lot of time for me to find a way to downgrade it without errors ðŸ¤•)
* Add *Typescript* also use *defineComponent* across components.
* Add *Vuetify 2* and *TailwindCSS* for styling, the font used in application is *Be Vietnam Pro* (shout out to my country ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³)
* Add *Zod* to create schema, let it parse through API response before sending data to components.
* Add some global constants such as API base URL, valid file format to easily change it globally.
* The image input only takes `.jpg`, `.jpeg` or `.png` format.
* Handling drag and drop files into the input instead of manually browsing it.
* This is not required, but I can do it to enhance the UX: Add options menu for each image like *View Detail*, *Download*, *Duplicate* and *Delete*.
